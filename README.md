# SignShop
It is a SignShop plugin.

It is a shop.

With signs.

Note: Depends on Coiny and Handy to be loaded before the plugin is called.

Format for a shop is

[SignShop]

pricetobuy:pricetosell

number of items

id

Where id is just the Minecraft id

So far, it is pretty basic. I plan on adding more things. Signs can be destroyed by anybody currently, however, I will probably add a permission for that. The permission for creating signs is:

SignShop.create
